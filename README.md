# Week 01: Getting Organized and Abstract Data Types

Welcome to the first week of CMPSCI 187. Each week will begin with the
release of new material that will be accessible from that week's
lesson plan (this document). The lesson plan for the week will be
accessible from the course website. The lesson plan will flow from top
to bottom and that is exactly how you should cover the material.

This week we will be covering Chapter's 1 and 2 from the book
Object-Oriented Data Structures Using Java, Third Edition. In
particular, we will be studying the basic structuring mechanisms
provided by Java, what data structures are, how to organize classes, a
little about software engineering, an overview of abstraction and why
it is important, Java interfaces, the `StringLog` abstract data type
(ADT), and how the `StringLog` interface can be implemented using
arrays and linked lists.

## Learning Goals

* Explain the software life-cycle activities.
* Describe the goals for quality software.
* Explain the benefits of object-oriented programming.
* Explain the difference between classes, objects, and inheritance.
* Explain how methods calls are bound to method implementations.
* Explain the difference between primitive and reference types.
* Explain and use Big-O notation to describe the amount of work done by an
  algorithm.
* Design and implement a Java class that uses primitive data types for its
  instance variables.
* Create a Java application that uses a Java class.
* Use packages to organize Java compilation units (Java source files).
* Predict the output of short segments of Java code that exhibit aliasing.
* Declare, initialize, and use Arrays of primitive and object types.
* Determine the Big-O complexity given a section of code.
* Explain abstraction, information hiding, data abstraction, data encapsulation,
  abstract data type.
* Describe the benefits of using an abstract data type.
* Describe the meanings of abstract method and interface for the Java
  programming language.
* Describe the benefits of using a Java interface to specify an ADT.
* Describe the StringLog ADT from three perspectives: logical level, application
  level, and implementation level.
* Classify class operations into the categories of constructor, observer, and
  transformer.
* Use the Java interface construct to specify an ADT.
* Use stepwise refinement to transform a high-level algorithm into code.
* Specify the preconditions and postconditions (effects) of a public method.
* Design a reasonable test plan for an ADT.
* Create a test driver for an ADT.
* Define and use a self-referential class to build a chain of objects (a linked
  structure).
* Draw figures representing a sequence of operations on a linked list.
* Implement the StringLog ADT as an array-based structure.
* Implement the StringLog ADT as a linked structure.
* Determine the Big-O complexity of each of the StringLog implementation
  methods.
* Use the StringLog ADT as a component of a solution to an application problem.
